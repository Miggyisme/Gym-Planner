# GymPlanner

A web app to log gym workouts, calculate training volume per muscle group, and visualize progress over time.

## Project Status

Under development.

## Scope

Gym-Planner aims to:

- Allow users to manually log their workouts (exercise name, sets, reps, and weight);
- Automatically detect the muscle group based on the exercise name;
- Calculate total training volume per muscle group (sets × reps × weight);
- Display total volume per muscle group on the main screen;
- Generate evolution charts over time.

## Notes

This README will be updated as the project evolves.  
Suggestions and future contributions are welcome!
